## serverless & lambda

### advantages

1. No server management is necessary.
2. Developers are only charged for the server space they use, reducing cost.
3. Serverless architectures are inherently scalable.
4. Quick deployments and updates are possible.
5. Code can run closer to the end user, decreasing latency.

### disadvantage

1. Testing and debugging become more challenging.
2. Serverless computing introduces new security concerns.
3. Serverless architectures are not built for long-running processes.
4. Performance may be affected.
5. Vendor lock-in is a risk.
